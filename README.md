Game Website For A Google Comp

I can't stress this enough how this doesn't work and it was made in a couple of hours and if you go through the project you can see valid code but most if it is made for the presentation and some stuff are invalid.

At the start we developed an app with flutter but because my friend did do his tasks we couldn't finish the app, so as a result we decied to create a website because we had more experience with web development then app.
